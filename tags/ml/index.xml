      <description>There is this hype of generative AI. Which usually is presented in a simplified manner of just &amp;ldquo;the AI&amp;rdquo;. It is like the cool kid. And like there was no ML/AI before. Just the age of darkness. The opposite is true. The term artificial intellingence (AI) is here since WWII and machine learning (ML) since 1960&amp;rsquo;s. And there were, and still are many fields which benefit from it, without being widely recognized.</description>
