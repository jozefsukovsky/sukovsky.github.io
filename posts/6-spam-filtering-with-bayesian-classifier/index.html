        <p>There is this hype of generative AI. Which usually is presented in a simplified manner of just &ldquo;the AI&rdquo;. It is like the cool kid. And like there was no ML/AI before. Just the age of darkness. The opposite is true. The term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intellingence (AI)</a> is here since WWII and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning (ML)</a> since 1960&rsquo;s. And there were, and still are many fields which benefit from it, without being widely recognized. In other words, we face them / use them for many years to decades, without realizing it.</p>
<p>One of them are spam filters, which were very widely established using among other approaches, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">naive bayes classifier</a>. Let&rsquo;s talk about the second one.</p>
<h2 id="being-sentimental">Being sentimental</h2>
<p>It was in early 00&rsquo;s, when I started gaining experience building mail servers. Back then, that was a common thing for many companies. From small to big ones. No Gmail, sorry. Just a webhosting service including email or, since particular company needs/size, a bare metal machine. During the 00&rsquo;s, that were times, when the spam was already pretty much a plague.</p>
<p>One of the duties we were doing as system administrators was collecting emails and marking them as spam (bad boys) vs ham (good boys) to train the spam filter. Even users have been using the spam folder
a bit differently than nowadays. If you received spam into your inbox, you moved it into the spam folder, what fed it into the spam filter.</p>
<p>One of the most signifficant components of the spam filter was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">naive bayes classifier</a>. During a period of time / an particular age, it was a very efficient spam protection tool, especially in a country where english is not the primary language. Even nowadays, if I receive some email full of some random words making no sense, I imagine how it tries to break through the classifier.</p>
<h2 id="bayes-everywhere">Bayes everywhere</h2>
<p>Once, in early 18th century, there was a guy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a>. He is mostly known as a statistician, thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes&rsquo; theorem</a>. It defines, how a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability</a> of a phenomenon/event relates to an opposite phenomenon/event. A foundations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian inference</a>. Which found home in many computer applications, namely the already mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes Classifier</a>, used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering">spam filters</a>.</p>
<p><em>A humble note: I won&rsquo;t explain everything in details, because I neither feel comfortable doing so, neither is it important for the purpose of the article.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>If we take any email message, there is a particular probability for each word to be used in spam messages vs in regular ones. <strong>TBA: early era viagra, nowadays attention, urgent reply, funds, bank accounts, transfers</strong>
An application takes an email message and calculates probabilities of each word, based on the existing database of trained words. At the end, there are two score values generated. A spam score and an ham score. And the relation between the spam score vs the ham score, having a threshold set, leads to the decision, what to do with that email.</p>
