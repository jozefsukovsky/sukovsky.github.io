      <description>No matter what you believe, no matter what you do. If you befriended Technical Debt, you already know, what&amp;rsquo;s coming. Eventually.
Here and there, social networks offer some technical debt related brawls, jokes, memes and more or less relevant thoughts. My thoughts are the grumpy ones.

      <description>Seeing some code snippets, sometimes hurts. Sometimes it hurts even more, realizing I&amp;rsquo;m the author. But very often, it hurts right in the beginning of the file. The imports.

      <description>Before I launched my website, I decided to make my life harder by creating an open-source Hugo theme. And the earth would stop rolling, if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t written this post about it.
